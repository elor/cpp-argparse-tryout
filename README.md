# C++ Bootstrap

Simple C++ Bootstrap:

* install dependencies using conan
* build project and tests with cmake
* test using ctest

Bonus:
* provides a dev-watch, i.e. continuous compilation and testing during development
* builds compile_commands.json, for use e.g. with Neovim

## Reasoning

C++ Bootstrapping is too tedious.
