# C++ Argparse tryout

Here's me trying out C++ [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)

## Why?

I was switching from [argumentum](https://github.com/mmahnic/argumentum) to [p-ranav/argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse), since argumentum isn't available in the Conan Center Index
